description: "Design-first flow. MUST invoke superpower-router:brainstorming, then hand off to superpower-router:plan-and-execute for Codex/Gemini execution routing."
---

Immediately invoke `superpower-router:brainstorming` and follow it exactly.

Non-optional handoff after design approval:
1. Invoke `superpower-router:plan-and-execute`.
2. Route implementation/refactor/review tasks to Codex CLI first.
3. Route external research/docs lookup tasks to Gemini CLI first.
4. Use Sonnet fallback only when runner exit codes indicate fallback.

description: Create implementation plan with explicit Codex/Gemini routing per task
---

Invoke `superpower-router:plan-and-execute` and follow it exactly.

Planning requirements:
1. Save plan in `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md`.
2. Keep tasks 2-5 minutes each and include concrete file paths and commands.
3. Add a routing decision per task:
   - Codex CLI for implementation/refactor/review
   - Gemini CLI for web/docs/external research
   - Claude only for orchestration/synthesis
